'''
Create a text file (using an editor, not necessarily Python) containing two tab 
separated columns, with each column containing a number. Then use Python to read 
through the file youâ€™ve created. For each line, multiply each first number by the 
second and include it in the file in third column. In last add a line Total, by 
summing the value of third column
Input File example: That you need to create

1   2
3   4
5   6
7   8
9   10
Output File Example:

1   2   2
3   4   12
5   6   30
7   8   56
9   10  90
Total   190
